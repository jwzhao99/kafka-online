<p>This GitHub repository contains the files and documentation for the Kafka Online (working title) project.</p>

<p>The aim of this project is to provide a modern, accessible online archive of the complete works of Franz Kafka. The hope is that this archive will be useful for research, teaching, and serve as a reliable source of information on Kafka's life and work for the general public.</p> 

This project was inspired by the <a href = "https://www.marktwainproject.org/homepage.html">Mark Twain Project</a> and the <a href = "http://www.nietzschesource.org/">Nietzsche Source</a>, two other free online resources devoted to the work of a single author.
